=head1 NAME

Test::Slow - Skip test that are too slow to run frequently

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Some test are too slow to run frequently. This module makes it
easy to skip slow tests so that you can run the others more
frequently. To mark a test as slow simply C<use> this module:

   use Test::Slow;
   use Test::More;
   ...
   done_testing;

To run just the quick tests, set the C<QUICK_TEST> environment
variable to a true value:

   $ QUICK_TEST=1 prove --lib t/*t


The other approach is to disable slow tests by default and run 
them only when requested :

   use Test::Slow "skip";
   use Test::More;
   ...
   done_testing;

To run even the slow tests, set the C<SLOW_TESTS> environment 
variable to a true value :

   $ SLOW_TEST=1 prove --lib t/*t
